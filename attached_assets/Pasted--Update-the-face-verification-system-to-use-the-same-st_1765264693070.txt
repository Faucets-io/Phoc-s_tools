Update the face-verification system to use the same style of movement indicators that Facebook uses during identity verification.

1. Indicator Style Requirements (Match Facebook)
	•	Use a curved bracket style indicator similar to Facebook’s
	•	It should look like a soft curved arrow/parenthesis
	•	Left indicator looks like this → (
	•	Right indicator looks like this → )
	•	The indicator must appear inside the camera frame, not outside
	•	Use smooth, modern animations like Facebook’s
	•	Indicator should gently pulse or glow to guide the user
	•	As the user turns, the indicator should slowly turn green (same as Facebook)

2. Behavior Requirements (Match Facebook Flow)

A. Left Turn
	•	Show the LEFT indicator (
	•	Instruction: “Turn your head to the left”
	•	As the user begins turning, the indicator starts changing color
	•	When the yaw angle reaches the required threshold (≈ –15°),
	•	The indicator becomes fully green
	•	A smooth “success” animation is shown (same style as Facebook)

B. Return to Center
	•	Indicator disappears
	•	Show “Return to center”
	•	Wait until yaw is between –5° and +5°

C. Right Turn
	•	Show the RIGHT indicator )
	•	Same color transition and animation style as Facebook

D. Complete
	•	When both directions are completed, show a Facebook-style ‘Liveness Complete’ animation
	•	Then proceed to face capture & verification

3. Technical Requirements

Use only free, open-source tools:
	•	MediaPipe Face Mesh (for head pose detection)
	•	OpenCV (for camera + drawing overlays)
	•	face_recognition (dlib) for verification

Use MediaPipe to determine:
	•	Yaw angle (left/right)
	•	Trigger indicators exactly like Facebook does.

4. Design Specification

The indicator should match Facebook’s:
	•	Shape (curved parenthesis-like bracket)
	•	Positioning (left/right edges of the face frame)
	•	Color behavior (grey → light green → full green)
	•	Smooth easing animation
	•	Subtle pulsing or breathing glow
	•	Visual clarity and simplicity
	•	Thickness and radius similar to Facebook’s bracket indicators

5. Deliverables
	•	Updated face-verification module
	•	Fully functioning Facebook-style left/right indicators
	•	Animation and color transition matching Facebook’s aesthetic
	•	Clean integration into current app
	•	Function name: runFacebookStyleFaceVerification()
